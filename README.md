# Flash memory dumper for 8051-based SinoWealth MCUs
Beware, this project is rather POC than user-friendly tool. I successfully used it to dump firmware from SH68F881W MCU in Genesis Thor 300 keyboard, but it should work with other chips of the same type.

## How to build
The project should be compiled easily in Arduino IDE and uploaded to some ATmega328P-based board or chip directly.
